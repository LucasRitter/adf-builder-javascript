# Contributing

Contributions to this library are welcome.

* For smaller changes, open a Pull Request directly.
* For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss the planned changes.

## Guidelines

* Ensure that test coverage remains close to 100%, run `yarn test:coverage` to find code that is not covered.
* Ensure code consistency by running `yarn lint` and fixing any reported errors (`yarn lint:fix` helps)
